# 🧠 ClickUp Task Field Filler — “To Contacted” Automation

## 🗂️ Project Overview
This project automates the process of **updating ClickUp task custom fields** based on status transitions.  
It was built to streamline lead management in ClickUp by automatically filling the **“Contacted”** field when a task moves from **“New Leads”** to **“Contacted.”**

The notebook uses the [ClickUp API](https://clickup.com/api) to:
- Retrieve all lists and tasks within a space  
- Check how long tasks have been in certain statuses  
- Identify when a lead becomes “Contacted”  
- Automatically update two custom fields:  
  - One for when the lead was first created  
  - Another for when it became contacted  

This saves hours of manual work and keeps CRM data consistent and up to date.
